Overview

This repository contains a real-time emotion detection system that uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect emotions from facial expressions. The system uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify emotions into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- Keras 2.4+
- TensorFlow 2.4+
- NumPy 1.20+
- SciPy 1.6+

Installation

1. Clone the repository using git clone.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Download the pre-trained model using the link provided in the model section.

Usage

1. Run the script using python.
2. The system will detect emotions from facial expressions in real-time.
3. Press q to quit the program.

Model

The pre-trained model used in this repository is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset. The model is available for download at [insert link].
